    <h3>how this was possible?</h3>
    <p>We all though that we won't get the money from everyone (45 students) so we thought 25 students giveing us ₹20 will be enough. but it wasn't. many people told us that first more people gave us money then they will give their money, and many said that they will not come or they will not give us money. we thought we will get ₹500 But we got ₹60.</p>
